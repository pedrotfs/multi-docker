Hi, this is a docker lesson trying to do a fibonacci calculator with a lot of not necessary steps.
It's overly complicated by definition to force a larger complexity to explore docker further.
for example, fibonacci is implemented using recursion, and the results use both redis and postgres.
the front uses react, the back end uses express and node.

the lesson I'm following is https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/11437202#overview
so far it's been great and I can't recommend this course enough if you wanna learn docker.

node_modules will not be commited. generate yours.
